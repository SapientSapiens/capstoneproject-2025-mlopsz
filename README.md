# 🚲Bike Sharing Demand Hourly Prediction

 ## 🧩Problem Description

  Bike sharing systems offer a flexible and eco-friendly way to navigate urban environments 🌆🚲. Users can rent a bike from one station and return it to another, thanks to automated kiosks spread across cities. With over 500+ programs worldwide, these systems have become vital to sustainable urban mobility 🌍♻️.

  But running them efficiently is a challenge.

  🔢 Operators must anticipate hourly fluctuations in bike demand


  ➡️ To ensure bikes are available when and where they’re needed


  ➡️ To prevent overcrowded or empty docking stations


  ➡️ To avoid resource wastage and customer dissatisfaction


  📉 Inaccurate demand forecasts lead to poor user experience and operational inefficiencies


  📊 The demand varies due to multiple factors like time of day, weather, season, or public events


  Now, the technical twist:


  ⚠️ Even well-performing ML models tend to degrade over time


  📉 This is caused by data drift — shifts in user behavior, weather trends, and unexpected anomalies (e.g., local festivals or global events like a pandemic)


  ❌ Without proper monitoring and updating, these models can make unreliable predictions that hurt business outcomes


  That’s why the challenge isn’t just about forecasting demand — it’s about keeping predictions accurate consistently, despite change 🌀



 ## 🧠Solution Overview

  This project presents a machine learning-based solution to forecast hourly bike rental demand. The approach involves combining historical usage data with external features like weather conditions and time-based variables to train a predictive model capable of estimating future demand.

  Beyond model accuracy, the project also implements MLOps practices to ensure the solution is scalable, maintainable, and reliable over time. This includes:

  🔄 Automated data preprocessing and feature engineering

  🧪 Experiment tracking for model comparison and reproducibility

  📦 Model versioning and registry for production readiness

  🌐 Deployment of the model as a robust, live prediction service

  📊 Scheduled model retraining workflows and continuous monitoring of drifts

  The result is not just a high-performing predictive model, but a __sustainable machine learning operation (MLOPS)__ pipeline that supports continuous improvements and long-term business value.
